When you are not able to automatically extract an API parameters definition you can use
the `api-parameters` fence plugin to manually document them.  

    ```api-parameters
    firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
    score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
    ```

```api-parameters
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
