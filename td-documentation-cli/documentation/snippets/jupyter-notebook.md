# Code and Output

Use `include-jupyter` to include [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook inside your documentation. 

    :include-jupyter: jupyter/simple-notebook.ipynb
    
:include-jupyter: jupyter/simple-notebook.ipynb

Note: Remember that you can define lookup paths for files like notebooks inside `lookup-paths` file, so you don't have
to copy and paste notebooks to your documentation directory.

# Seamless Markdown Integration

Markdown from your notebook will be seamlessly integrated into your current page. First level `# headers` will
become part of Table Of Contents and part of a search unit.
