Besides local search capabilities, `Znai` provides a search entry `XML` file for your documentation. This file can be crawled to expose your documentation to external search engines. 

Your search entry file can be located at the following endpoint: `<base-url>/<doc-id>/search-entries.xml`

For example, the search entry for the `Znai` documentation on Github is located at [https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/search-entries.xml](https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/search-entries.xml)
