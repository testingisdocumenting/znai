# Markdown

`Znai` uses Markdown, a markup language that uses ASCII to represent styles and page structure.

```markdown-and-result
# Header

Normal paragraph text. Some *italic* and **bold**.
Followed by bullet points:
* Apple
* Banana
* Water
```

# External References

Additionally, you can keep your documentation up to date and accurate by referencing existing resources.

```markdown
# Server Configuration

:include-file: config/server.config
```

Note:  This `include-file` macro is a `Znai` extension and not part of a standard Markdown syntax.
