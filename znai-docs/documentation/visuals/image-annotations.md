:include-file: annotations.json {title: "annotations.json"}

There are different types of annotations:
* Circles
* Rectangles
* Arrows
* etc.

# Integration With Testing

It is possible to generate annotations file by using UI testing framework.

For example [webtau](https://github.com/twosigma/webtau) automatically generates annotations file in addition to 
capturing a screenshot. 

# Presentation Mode

Annotated images automatically participate in presentation mode. Annotations appear one by one and scale to match the
zoom level of a presentation.
