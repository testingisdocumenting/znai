# Unified Tabs

In two sides layout tabs selection is moved to a single place (default is top right panel).

# Definition 

To define multiple tabs we use fenced code block

    ```tabs
    JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
    Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java 
    Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
    ```
    
This will generate a multi tab widget with an include plugin content per tab.

Note: Selecting a tab will switch all the tabs on every page.

:include-meta: {rightSide: true}

```tabs
JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java 
Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
```

# Markdown Per Tab

Any valid markdown can be used in place of a content of each tab.
Typical use case for *installation instructions*: extract differences per language or environment
