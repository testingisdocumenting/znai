# Primary Use Case

Imagine your product supports multiple ways of achieving a final result: 
* REST
* Web
* CLI
* Java
* Python
* more...

Provide a selection inside your documentation if your user needs only one to accomplish the goal. 
Selections will persist for users and provide streamlined experience.

Do not: use tabs as navigation experience. 
If your user needs both `Java` and `Python` executed one by one you need to show steps one after another in proper order.
 
# Definition 

To define multiple tabs we use fenced code block:

    ```tabs
    JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
    Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java
    Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
    ```
    
This will generate a multi-tab widget with `include-` plugin content for each tab.

```tabs
JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java {wide: true}
Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
```

Selecting a tab will switch all the tabs on every page.

# Markdown Per Tab

Any valid Markdown can be used in place of `include-` content. 

A typical use case for *installation instructions* might be dividing content per language or environment:

    ````tabs
    JavaScript: 
    First you need to download WebStorm and then run following using your terminal
    
    ```bash
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start
    ```
        
    Java: 
    First you need to download Intellij IDEA and then run following using your terminal
        
    ```bash
    $ mvn install
    $ mvn exec:exec
    ```
        
    Cpp: 
    First you need to download CLion and then run following using your terminal
    
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    $ whoamis
    ```
    ````
    
````tabs
JavaScript: 
First you need to download WebStorm and then run following using your terminal

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
    
Java: 
First you need to download Intellij IDEA and then run following using your terminal
    
```bash
$ mvn install
$ mvn exec:exec
```
    
Cpp: 
First you need to download CLion and then run following using your terminal

```bash
$ pwd
$ whoamis
```

# Separate Markdown files

Consider extracting content to separate markup files if content becomes long.
Use the `include-markdown` plugin to include external content.

    ```tabs
    JavaScript: :include-markdown: instructions/javascript-install.md
    Java: :include-markdown: instructions/java-install.md
    Cpp: :include-markdown: instructions/cpp-install.md
    ```

Each tab will display inlined markdown from specified files.

```tabs
JavaScript: :include-markdown: instructions/javascript-install.md
Java: :include-markdown: instructions/java-install.md
Cpp: :include-markdown: instructions/cpp-install.md
```

# Attention Signs

Use extra space(s) in front of `Note:` or other attention sign keywords to put attention signs inside a tab. 
Remember if you put 4+ spaces your paragraph will become a code snippet

    
    ````tabs
    JavaScript: 
    
    ```bash
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start
    ```
    
     Avoid: committing node_modules
        
    Java: 
    First you need to download Intellij IDEA and then run following using your terminal
        
    ```bash
    $ mvn install
    $ mvn exec:exec
    ```
        
     Warning: `mvn` install for the first time may take considerable amount of time
    
    Cpp: 
    First you need to download CLion and then run following using your terminal
    
    ```bash
    $ pwd
    $ whoamis
    ```
