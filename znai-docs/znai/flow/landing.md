# Optional Index Landing Page

Optional `index.md` file in the root is your landing page. Consider putting logos and high level information about 
your product there.

Note: Landing page is not part of your Table Of Contents and is not present on navigation panel. Don't put essential information
there as users may not get back there often. 

# Auto Redirect

Use `:include-redirect: chapter/page` to automatically redirect from index page to any other page in your docs.
Use it if you don't know what to put on Landing Page or find yourself repeating the content in your next introduction page.

If `index.md` is not present, users will be redirected to the first page in your Table Of Contents.
