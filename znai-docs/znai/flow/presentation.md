# Equal Flow

:include-meta: {presentationParagraph: "default"}

When people build presentations, there should be great focus on the flow of information, making sure that those newly introduced to the topic are not lost. A poorly organized presentation might drive users seeking clarification to documentation, which too often is just as unfriendly to neophytes.

Presentation mode in `Znai` is meant to help with both issues, mutually reinforcing good flow in presentations and documentation.

# Presentation Mode

`Znai` can turn any page into a presentation. Simply click `:icon:maximize` to the far right of each page title.

In presentation mode, only certain documentation elements are converted to slides:

* Headings
* Bullets
* Images and graphics
* Code snippets
* Command line input
* Math
* Tables

If you write your documentation with a presentation in mind it should improve the flow of your documentation.
