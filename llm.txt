# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Markdown
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#markdown

The fastest way to learn Markdown is to go to [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) website and go through a 60 second cheatsheet or 10 minute tutorial.

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Running Znai
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#running-znai

Znai is available as

- [Command Line](#command-line)
- [Maven Plugin](#maven-plugin)

Both command line and maven plugin lets you to build documentation website and also run preview server during documentation writing process.

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Command Line
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#command-line

## CLI download

Download and unzip [znai](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/testingisdocumenting/znai/znai-dist/1.85.2/znai-dist-1.85.2-znai.zip). Add it to your `PATH`.

## Brew

```cli
brew install testingisdocumenting/brew/znai
```

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Maven Plugin
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#maven-plugin

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.testingisdocumenting.znai</groupId>
    <artifactId>znai-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.85.2</version>
</plugin>
```

Note: consider adding a separate module for documentation in the multi module maven project

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Scaffolding
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#scaffolding

To create a minimum set of files for your documentation execute


```
znai    
   |--chapter-one
             |--page-one.md
             |--page-two.md
   |--chapter-two
             |--page-three.md
             |--page-four.md
   |--toc
   |--lookup-paths
   |--meta.json
```

Listed above directories and files will be generated in the current directory.

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Preview Mode
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#preview-mode

Znai comes with `preview` mode. In `preview` mode, znai monitors changes you apply to the documentation files and notifies browser to navigates to the right page and highlights the changes.

To start preview mode, navigate to the documentation directory (`znai` if you used scaffold) and run


Open URL output by the command and open in a browser. Blue *eye* icon in the top right corner indicates that preview is on.

Open any text editor, modify and save a markdown file. Changes will be reflected in the browser.

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: Static Site Generation
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#static-site-generation

To build static documentation site you need to provide `documentation id`. Documentation id becomes part of your url and is also used inside generated HTMLs to reference static resources using absolute path.

For example, znai original documentation is hosted on [https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai](https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai) and documentation id is `znai`.

This original page is hosted on [https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/introduction/getting-started](https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/introduction/getting-started). znai generates each page as index.html and puts inside directories to make it possible to have an extension less urls.

To make it easier to handle static resources loading, Znai builds all the urls inside HTML pages using absolute locations, and that's why it is required to provide `documentation id` during the site generation.

To generate static site, use

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: GitHub Pages
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#github-pages

To deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) use [GitHub Pages Action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages).

Here is an example of znai publishing its documentation to github pages

```yaml
- name: deploy documentation
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./znai-docs/target/znai
```

# Introduction :: Getting Started :: On-site Central Hub Deployment
answer-link: znai/introduction/getting-started#on-site-central-hub-deployment

Znai has enterprise mode that lets you run Documentation hub inside your organization. It is completely free and open sourced.

Please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/issues) if you want to try it out. I don't document it yet as I only have a couple of scenarios I tried it on, and I need more input.

# Flow :: Structure :: Building Blocks
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#building-blocks

`Znai` has three levels of documentation organization:

- Chapters
- Pages
- Page Sections

`Znai` encourages authors to split their content across multiple pages.

If you feel like you need to use nested headings, consider moving your content hierarchy one level up:

- Split overlong page into multiple ones
- Introduce chapters
- Focus on one thing at a time

# Flow :: Structure :: Similarity with OOP
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#similarity-with-oop

It may be useful to compare documentation design to an object-oriented programming approach:

- Chapters as `packages`
- Pages as `classes`
- Page Sections as `methods`

It is a bad practice to have a class with loosely related methods. Similarly, it is a bad practice to have a long page with loosely related sections.

# Flow :: Structure :: Table of Contents
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#table-of-contents

Each documentation must have `toc` file in its root. This file contains chapters and pages.

This is a `toc` file for this documentation.

Take a look at the left side bar and compare it with the file content.

The top entry, `introduction`, corresponds to the directory of the same name. The nested entry, `rationale`, corresponds to the file `rationale.md`.

# Flow :: Structure :: Pages Without Chapters
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#pages-without-chapters

You can define TOC without having chapters. Specify file names with extension without adding any indentation:

```
page-one.md
page-two.md
optional-chapter
   page-three.md
   page-four.md
```

# Flow :: Structure :: Sub Headings
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#sub-headings

Only a first level heading is treated as a first class citizen:

- Part of **TOC**
- Smallest unit of **search result**

```
# First Class Citizen
```

Nested sub headings only add visual distinction within a page.

```
## Sub heading
content of sub heading

### Sub Sub heading
content of sub sub heading
```

## Sub heading

content of sub heading

### Sub Sub heading

content of sub sub heading

# Flow :: Structure :: Heading Allowed Content
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#heading-allowed-content

Keep headings text simple and short.

Try to avoid putting extra formatting into headings: inconsistent heading look and feel can feel distracting.

Note: Only inlined code and Links are allowed as part of the heading content. Consider sticking to a regular text.

# Flow :: Structure :: Meta
answer-link: znai/flow/structure#meta

Each documentation must have the `meta.json` file in its root. This `JSON` file contains documentation display name, type, and optional `View On` information.

```json
{
  "title": "Znai",
  "type": "User Guide",
  "category": "Documentation",
  "description": "Build functional, maintainable, beautiful User Guides with markdown and Znai plugins. Instant pages navigation. Local search. Multiple integrations to work with Python, Java, C++, OpenAPI, etc. Transform \"getting started\" sections into slideshow for your workshops. Manage multiple documentations with self-deployed znai hub.",
  "hidePresentationTrigger": false,
  "viewOn": {
    "link": "https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/blob/master/znai-docs/znai",
    "title": "View Markdown"
  },
  "support": {
    "link": "https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/discussions",
    "title": "GitHub"
  }
}
```

# Flow :: Landing :: Optional Index Landing Page
answer-link: znai/flow/landing#optional-index-landing-page

Optional `index.md` file in the root is your landing page. Consider putting logos and high level information about your product there.

Note: Landing page is not part of your Table Of Contents and is not present on navigation panel. Don't put essential information there as users may not get back there often.

# Flow :: Landing :: Auto Redirect
answer-link: znai/flow/landing#auto-redirect

Use `include-redirect` plugin to automatically redirect from index page to any other page in your docs.

```markdown
:include-redirect: chapter/page
```

Use it if you don't know what to put on Landing Page or find yourself repeating the content in your next introduction page.

If `index.md` is not present, users will be redirected to the first page in your Table Of Contents.

# Flow :: Page Titles :: Automatic Names
answer-link: znai/flow/names#automatic-names

By default, page names are automatically derived from file names. `file-name.md` has the page title `File Name`.

# Flow :: Page Titles :: Name Overrides
answer-link: znai/flow/names#name-overrides

To override the default, add the following syntax to the top of your Markdown file:

```
---
title: Custom Name
---
```

To keep things easy for future documentation owners, it's good practice to keep page and file names the same. In some cases, however, you want to make exceptions, for example, in cases where you:

- Need to use special characters in title
- Want to avoid auto-capitalization

Another way to override a page title is by adding a `title` to `toc` file

```text
chapter-one
    structure {title: "Underlying Structure"} 
    setup
```

Note: Title defined in `toc` takes precedence over `title` inside markup file

# Flow :: Page Titles :: Chapter Names
answer-link: znai/flow/names#chapter-names

By default, a chapter name is derived from dir name. Dir name `my-chapter` becomes `My Chapter` chapter name.

To override a chapter name, use `{title: "chapter title"}` inside `toc` file

```text
chapter-one {title: "Chapter ONE explicit"} 
    structure
    setup
```

# Flow :: Page References :: Follow the Order
answer-link: znai/flow/page-references#follow-the-order

Good documentation flows naturally. Links to navigate to the next page are at the end of each page.

Create links to remind users of *essential* concepts introduced previously. There is a good chance that a reader skipped over these or forgot about them.

Avoid: links that navigate users forward. It may break the flow of a documentation.

# Flow :: Page References :: Links
answer-link: znai/flow/page-references#links

To create an `external` link use:

```markdown
[Link Title](http://external/reference)
```

To refer `internal` page within your documentation use:

```markdown
[internal link](../dir-name/file-name.md#optional-page-section-id)
[internal link](./file-name.md#optional-page-section-id)
[internal link](dir-name/file-name#optional-page-section-id)
```

Note: you can get `page-section-id` by hovering over a section title and pressing link icon. Your browser URL display the updated link.

## Links to Subsection

Linking to subsections is the same as linking to a top level section. [Here is an  example](#links-links-to-subsection)

```markdown
[Here is an example](flow/page-references#links-links-to-subsection)
```

Use [Subsection Shortcut](#links) if a subsection is within the same page:

```markdown
[Subsection Shortcut](#links)
```

## Index Page

Clicking this [index page](/) link will have the same effect as clicking the documentation title at the top of the **Navigation Panel**

To refer back to the top-level `index` page use:

```markdown
[index page](/)
[index page](/#link-to-subsection)
```

# Flow :: Page References :: Downloads
answer-link: znai/flow/page-references#downloads

Linking to a local file will deploy the file along with the generated documentation. Clicking the link will open a file using the browser's default method.

```
Download [test json file](data/test.json)
```

Download [test json file](data/test.json)

# Flow :: Page References :: Custom Anchor Id
answer-link: znai/flow/page-references#custom-anchor-id

Use `{#anchori-id}` after section title to set a custom anchor:

```markdown
## Section With Custom Anchor {#my-custom-id}
```

## Section With Custom Anchor

# Flow :: Page References :: Validation
answer-link: znai/flow/page-references#validation

Local links are automatically validated during documentation build time. You will get a build time error if you refer to a page or a section/sub-section that does not exist.

Pass `--validate-external-links` to enable external links validation.

# Flow :: Page Toc
answer-link: znai/flow/page-toc

Use `include-page-toc` to include page top level sections as links

```markdown
:include-page-toc:
```

# Flow :: Page Toc :: Section One
answer-link: znai/flow/page-toc#section-one

some text

# Flow :: Page Toc :: Section Two
answer-link: znai/flow/page-toc#section-two

some other text

# Flow :: Lookup Paths :: Files Reference Lookup
answer-link: znai/flow/lookup-paths#files-reference-lookup

When you refer to a file using plugins like

```markdown
:include-file: my-file.cpp
```

`Znai` tries to find the file in following locations:

- directory with the markup file that refers `my-file.cpp`
- documentation root directory
- locations enumerated inside `<doc-root>/lookup-paths` file

```txt
../examples
../module/src/main/java
```

# Flow :: Lookup Paths :: CLI parameter
answer-link: znai/flow/lookup-paths#cli-parameter

Use `--lookup-paths` CLI parameter to add additional paths to lookup files.

```cli
znai --lookup-paths /extra/path-one /extra/path-two
```

# Flow :: Lookup Paths :: Zip and Jar Lookup
answer-link: znai/flow/lookup-paths#zip-and-jar-lookup

When Znai encounters zip or jar file listed inside `lookup-paths` it will unpack the archives into a temporary location and will use those locations to resolve files

```txt
../sources.zip
../module/archive.jar
```

```
:include-file: dir/inside-zip-b.txt
```

```txt
inside
zip
B
```

# Flow :: Lookup Paths :: HTTP Lookup Location
answer-link: znai/flow/lookup-paths#http-lookup-location

If files you want to include are not part of your project, you can add an HTTP base URL to `lookup-paths`.

```txt
../examples
../module/src/main/java
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testingisdocumenting/webtau/master
```

If the file is not found using local locations, it will be fetched from the provided urls.

```
:include-file: .travis.yml
```

```yaml
language: java

jdk:
  - openjdk8
  - openjdk11

cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.m2
  - $HOME/.npm
  - node_modules

dist: xenial

services:

  firefox: latest
  apt:
    packages:
      - graphviz

# disables the default install step which is mvn install skipping tests
install: true

script: mvn -B verify -P code-coverage
```

# Flow :: Lookup Paths :: Class Path Lookup
answer-link: znai/flow/lookup-paths#class-path-lookup

Znai is written using Java and can access resources from the classpath. Using class path lookup you can include snippets from projects deployed to, for example, Maven Central.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.testingisdocumenting.znai</groupId>
    <artifactId>znai-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>${junit.version}</version>
            <classifier>sources</classifier>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

```
:include-java: org/junit/Assert.java {entry: "fail(String)"}
```

# Flow :: Search :: Local
answer-link: znai/flow/search#local

To perform a local search of your documentation press `/` key or click the search section in the side panel on the left.

In [documentation structure](flow/structure) we learned that documentation consist of

- Chapters
- Pages
- Page Sections

These entities play different and important roles in search. Search treats each *Page Section* as an independent unit. Each *Page Section* has an internally defined title that is a combination of all three titles.

Title match during search yields the highest score.

For example this current section full title is: *Flow Search Local*.

As your documentation grows, keep checking how easy it is to navigate to a section of your documentation using `/`.

Avoid: using generic names in your page titles and page section titles. You should not have dozens of pages called *Introduction*

# Flow :: Search :: Global
answer-link: znai/flow/search#global

Besides local search capabilities, `Znai` provides a search entry `XML` file for your documentation. This file can be crawled to expose your documentation to external search engines.

Your search entry file can be located at the following endpoint: `<base-url>/<doc-id>/search-entries.xml`

For example, the search entry for the `Znai` documentation on Github is located at [https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/search-entries.xml](https://testingisdocumenting.org/znai/search-entries.xml)

# Flow :: Llm :: Context For LLMs
answer-link: znai/flow/llm#context-for-llms

Note: Initial experimental support

Znai generates a single markdown file called `llm.txt` to be used by LLMs. It is deployed at the root of the documentation and can be used in multiple scenarios. The primary use case is to provide guide context to systems like Claude Code.

# Flow :: Llm :: Generate During Build To Keep In Repository
answer-link: znai/flow/llm#generate-during-build-to-keep-in-repository



# Flow :: Footer :: Definition
answer-link: znai/flow/footer#definition

To define a footer, create a `footer.md` file in the root directory of your documentation files. Footer content will be treated as regular page content, i.e., you can use the standard Markdown and all the custom extensions.

Content in `footer.md` will be displayed at the bottom of each page.

# Flow :: Support :: Linking To Support Site
answer-link: znai/flow/support#linking-to-support-site

To provide a support link to your users add link and title to the `meta.json` file.

```json
{
  "title": "Znai",
  "type": "User Guide",
  "category": "Documentation",
  "description": "Build functional, maintainable, beautiful User Guides with markdown and Znai plugins. Instant pages navigation. Local search. Multiple integrations to work with Python, Java, C++, OpenAPI, etc. Transform \"getting started\" sections into slideshow for your workshops. Manage multiple documentations with self-deployed znai hub.",
  "hidePresentationTrigger": false,
  "viewOn": {
    "link": "https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/blob/master/znai-docs/znai",
    "title": "View Markdown"
  },
  "support": {
    "link": "https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/discussions",
    "title": "GitHub"
  }
}
```

Take a look at the example at the top of this page.

# Flow :: Footnotes :: Definition
answer-link: znai/flow/footnotes#definition

To define a footnote use

```
[^my-id]: extra content for my footnote goes here
potentially including code blocks
```
Constructor()
```
```

To add a reference to the footnote use `[^my-id]` which will result in [^my-id]

[^my-id]:

# Flow :: Footnotes :: Preview
answer-link: znai/flow/footnotes#preview

Hover mouse over a footnote reference see its content in a tooltip.

# Flow :: Presentation :: Equal Flow
answer-link: znai/flow/presentation#equal-flow



When people build presentations, there should be great focus on the flow of information, making sure that those newly introduced to the topic are not lost. A poorly organized presentation might drive users seeking clarification to documentation, which too often is just as unfriendly to neophytes.

Presentation mode in `Znai` is meant to help with both issues, mutually reinforcing good flow in presentations and documentation.

# Flow :: Presentation :: Presentation Mode
answer-link: znai/flow/presentation#presentation-mode

`Znai` can turn any page into a presentation. Simply click  to the far right of each page title.

In presentation mode, only certain documentation elements are converted to slides:

- Headings
- Bullets
- Images and graphics
- Code snippets
- Command line input
- Math
- Tables

If you write your documentation with a presentation in mind it should improve the flow of your documentation.

# Flow :: Testing Is Documenting :: Auto Maintainable Content
answer-link: znai/flow/testing-is-documenting#auto-maintainable-content

There is a lot of content you can get by leveraging automated testing. And most importantly that content is going to be auto maintained.

Let's say you document a command line tool, and you want to provide an example of some operation output. You can copy and paste the output risking it being outdated. Or, you can write a test that exercises a command line and also captures its output.

You end up getting a lot of benefits:

- your app is tested
- your documentation is auto updated

# Flow :: Testing Is Documenting :: Examples
answer-link: znai/flow/testing-is-documenting#examples

In addition to command line tools, here are some common scenarios you should consider:

- Test Web UI - *application screenshots*
- Test Business Logic - *tabular data*
- Test REST API - *API JSON real examples*
- Config files
- Script snippets
- Runtime dependencies DAGs
- ...

# Flow :: Testing Is Documenting :: Self Powering Cycle
answer-link: znai/flow/testing-is-documenting#self-powering-cycle

As you write your documentation you will come up with new scenarios to test. As you write tests, think about your documentation and what test-produced artifacts can improve it.

Znai provides a lot of utilities to include test artifacts.

In [Synergy With Testing](synergy-with-testing/web-UI) chapter you will see examples of UI, REST API and Business Logic.

answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#specifying-language

You can also specify a language to enable syntax highlighting for your snippet.

```
```javascript
import React from 'react'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        /// ...
    }
}
```
```

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        /// ...
    }
}
```

The following languages/formats are supported:

- C++
- OCaml
- Python
- TypeScript
- Java
- SQL
- JSON
- Protobuf
- JavaScript
- Groovy
- Bash

`Znai` uses [prismjs](http://prismjs.com) library to provide syntax highlighting. Note that it is not being executed inside the browser, but rather applied during HTML generation.

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Title
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#title

Use the `title` property to specify a title.

```
```javascript {title: "ReactJS Component"}
...
```
```

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        /// ...
    }
}
```

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Anchor
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#anchor

When you specify a title, hover mouse over it to see a clickable anchor.

Use `anchorId` to override auto generated identifier.

```
```javascript {title: "ReactJS Component", anchorId: "my-special-code"}
...
```
```

```javascript
import React from 'react'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    /// ...
  }
}
```

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Wide Code
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#wide-code

Use the `wide` option to stretch wide code to occupy as much horizontal real estate as possible.

```
```java {wide: true}
class InternationalPriceService implements PriceService {
    private static void LongJavaInterfaceNameWithSuperFactory createMegaAbstractFactory(final ExchangeCalendarLongerThanLife calendar) {
        ...
    }
}
```
```

```java
class InternationalPriceService implements PriceService {
    private static void LongJavaInterfaceNameWithSuperFactory createMegaAbstractFactory(final ExchangeCalendarLongerThanLife calendar) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Without the `wide` option code will be aligned with the rest of the text and users can use scrollbars.

```java
class InternationalPriceService implements PriceService {
    private static void LongJavaInterfaceNameWithSuperFactory createMegaAbstractFactory(final ExchangeCalendarLongerThanLife calendar) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Note: Good placement of a *Wide Code* element is at the end of a page or a section to show the full version of a code sample.

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Wrap Code
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#wrap-code

Use the `wrap` option to stretch wide code to occupy as much horizontal real estate as possible.

```
```java {wrap: true}
class InternationalPriceService implements PriceService {
    private static void LongJavaInterfaceNameWithSuperFactory createMegaAbstractFactory(final ExchangeCalendarLongerThanLife calendar) {
        ...
    }
}
```
```

```java
class InternationalPriceService implements PriceService {
    private static void LongJavaInterfaceNameWithSuperFactory createMegaAbstractFactory(final ExchangeCalendarLongerThanLife calendar) {
        ...
    }
}
```

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Read More
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#read-more

If you have a large code snippet and you want to initially display only a small fraction use the `readMore` option with an **optional** `readMoreVisibleLines` option to specify a number of initial lines displayed (default is 8).

```
```java {readMore: true, readMoreVisibleLines: 3}
public class DocScaffolding {
    private final Path workingDir;
    private Map<String, List<String>> fileNameByDirName;
    ...
```
```

```java
public class DocScaffolding {
    private final Path workingDir;
    private Map<String, List<String>> fileNameByDirName;

    public DocScaffolding(Path workingDir) {
        this.workingDir = workingDir;
        this.fileNameByDirName = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    }

    public void create() {
        createPages();
        createToc();
        createMeta();
        createIndex();
        createLookupPaths();
    }

    private void createLookupPaths() {
        createFileFromResource("lookup-paths");
    }

    private void createMeta() {
        createFileFromResource("meta.json");
    }
}
```

# Snippets :: Code Snippets :: Highlights
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-snippets#highlights

Use the `highlight` option to bring readers attention to important lines.

```
```java {highlight: "workingDir"}
public class DocScaffolding {
    private final Path workingDir;
    private Map<String, List<String>> fileNameByDirName;

    public DocScaffolding(Path workingDir) {
    ...
    }
```
```

```java
public class DocScaffolding {
    private final Path workingDir;
    private Map<String, List<String>> fileNameByDirName;

    public DocScaffolding(Path workingDir) {
    ...
    }
```

# Snippets :: External Code Snippets :: Embedding Content
answer-link: znai/snippets/external-code-snippets#embedding-content

To reduce documentation maintenance burden avoid copy and paste of code snippets. Embed content by referencing existing files using the `include-file` plugin instead.

```
:include-file: file-name.js
```

This `include-` syntax will appear throughout the documentation and represents a family of custom Markdown extensions.

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

The file will be looked up using following rules:

- directory with a markup file
- root directory of a documentation
- all lookup paths listed in a `lookup-paths` file

# Snippets :: External Code Snippets :: Syntax highlighting
answer-link: znai/snippets/external-code-snippets#syntax-highlighting

Syntax highlighting is automatically selected based file extension. E.g. extensions `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp` are treated as C++.

```
:include-file: simple.c
```

```c
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "hello";
}
```

```
:include-file: Hello.sc
```

```sc
object Hello {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println("Hello, world")
  }
}
```

Use `lang` to force a different syntax highlighting

```
:include-file: simple.c {lang: "java"}
```

```java
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "hello";
}
```

Note: File extensions and `lang` are case-insensitive.

# Snippets :: External Code Snippets :: Title
answer-link: znai/snippets/external-code-snippets#title

```
:include-file: file-name.js {title: "ES6 class"} 
```

Use the `title` property to specify a title.

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

Use the `autoTitle` property to set `title` to be the file name.

```
:include-file: file-name.js {autoTitle: true} 
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

# Snippets :: External Code Snippets :: Anchor
answer-link: znai/snippets/external-code-snippets#anchor

When you specify a title, hover mouse over it to see a clickable anchor.

Use `anchorId` to override auto generated identifier.

```
:include-file: file-name.js {autoTitle: true, anchorId: "my-code-anchor"}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

# Snippets :: External Code Snippets :: Wide Code
answer-link: znai/snippets/external-code-snippets#wide-code

Use the `wide` option to stretch wide code to occupy as much horizontal screen real estate as possible.

```

import market
# example-import-block

def main():
    # example: book trade
    id = market.book_trade('symbol', market.CURRENT_PRICE, 100)
    # example-end

    # example-cancel-trade
    market.cancel_trade(id)
    # example-cancel-trade

if __name__  == "__main__":
    main()
```

```
:include-file: python-examples.py {startLine: "example: book trade", endLine: "example-end"}
```

```py
# example: book trade
id = market.book_trade('symbol', market.CURRENT_PRICE, 100)
# example-end
```

Note: Lines match doesn't have to be exact, `contains` is used.

By default  and  are included in the rendered result. Use  to remove markers.

```
:include-file: python-examples.py { 
    startLine: "example: book trade",
    endLine: "example-end",
    excludeStartEnd: true }
```

```py
id = market.book_trade('symbol', market.CURRENT_PRICE, 100)
```

To exclude start or end line only use  and

# Snippets :: Snippets Manipulation :: Start/End Multiple Lines
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-manipulation#start-end-multiple-lines

Pass multiple values to `startLine` and `endLine` to specify more precisely a block of code to extract.

As example, let's extract a second `match` block from the code snippets below without adding extra markers:

```ml
type weather_season =
  | Spring
  | Summer
  | Autumn
  | Winter

let weight_season season =
  match season with
  | Spring -> 4
  | Summer -> 5
  | Autumn -> 3
  | Winter -> -1

let describe_season season =
(** human readable season description *)
  match season with
  | Spring -> "It's springtime! Flowers are blooming."
  | Summer -> "It's summertime! Enjoy the warm weather."
  | Autumn -> "It's autumn! Leaves are changing colors."
  | Winter -> "It's winter! Time to bundle up and enjoy the snow."
```

if we use `startLine: "match season"`, we can't guarantee what block will it pick, and it will depend on functions order.

To hit the exact one use multiple start lines. Znai will attempt to find a combination of start lines with the smallest distance between them:

```
:include-file: ocaml/seasons.ml {startLine: ["let describe_season", "match season"], startLineKeepLast: true}
```

```ml
match season with
| Spring -> "It's springtime! Flowers are blooming."
| Summer -> "It's summertime! Enjoy the warm weather."
| Autumn -> "It's autumn! Leaves are changing colors."
| Winter -> "It's winter! Time to bundle up and enjoy the snow."
```

Note: Use `endLine` and `endLineKeepFirst` to limit lines from the bottom. `excludeStart` removes all the lines between specified start lines, including the lines. `excludeEnd` removes all the lines between specified end lines, including the lines.

# Snippets :: Snippets Manipulation :: Include Contains
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-manipulation#include-contains

Use  to include only lines containing specified text(s).

```
:include-file: python-examples.py { include: "import " }

    market.cancel_trade(id)
```

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Line By Text
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#line-by-text

Use the `highlight` option to bring readers attention to the important lines.

```
:include-file: file-name.js {highlight: "export"}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Line By Index
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#line-by-index

It is recommended to pass a substring, but you can pass a line idx (starts from 0). Additionally, you can combine two approaches and pass a list of things to highlight.

```
:include-file: file-name.js {highlight: ["export", 1]}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

Note: Order of lines to highlight is reflected during presentation mode

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Text From File
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#text-from-file

Use the `highlightPath` option to highlight lines specified in a separate file.

```
:include-file: file-name.js {highlightPath: "lines-to-highlight.txt"}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

```txt
class
usefulAction
```

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Region
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#region

Use the `highlightRegion` to highlight large portions of the code as one highlight block:

```
:include-file: file-name.js {highlightRegion: {start: "constructor", end: "}"}}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Region Using Scope
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#region-using-scope

Use the `highlightRegion.scope` to highlight region using scope like `{}`. Unlike example above, highlight will not stop at first closing `}`:

```
:include-file: with-nested-if.js {highlightRegion: {start: "userId ===", scope: "{}"}}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    usefulAction() {
        if (userId === "user-a") {
            if (canRead(userId)) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Use multiple start lines to narrow down a specific region

```
:include-file: with-multiple-if-clarify.js {highlightRegion: {
  start: ["if (userId ===", "canRead"], scope: "{}"}
}
```

Znai will find a smallest text block that contains all specified lines and then highlight the most inner one:

```js
class JsClass {
    usefulAction() {
        if (userId === "user-a") {
            // ...
        }

        if (canRead(userId)) {
            // ...
        }

        if (userId === "user-a") {
            // ...
            if (canRead(userId)) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Snippets :: Snippets Highlighting :: Multiple Regions
answer-link: znai/snippets/snippets-highlighting#multiple-regions

Use list to specify multiple regions to highlight:

```markdown
:include-file: with-multiple-if.js {highlightRegion: [
  {start: "canRead", scope: "{}"},
  {start: "canWrite", scope: "{}"}]
}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    usefulAction() {
        if (userId === "user-a") {
            if (canRead(userId)) {
                // ...
            }
        }
        if (userId === "user-b") {
            if (canWrite(userId)) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Snippets :: Code Comments :: Callout Comments
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-comments#callout-comments

Use `commentsType: "inline"` to extract comments from a code and render them as bullet points

Given a file with comments

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() { // new syntax for constructor
    }
}

export default JsClass // new syntax for ES6 modules

# Snippets :: Inlined Code Snippets :: Validated Identifier
answer-link: znai/snippets/inlined-code-snippets#validated-identifier



```py
def example():
    my_func(100)
```

Specify multiple files via [page local](plugins/default-parameters#page-local-defaults) or [global](plugins/default-parameters#global-defaults) plugin defaults to avoid repeating `validationPath` throughout the page.

```md
---
identifier: {validationPath: ["python/my_func_usage.py", "python/utils.py"]}
---
```

```markdown
my text `:identifier: my_func`
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Inlined CSV
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#inlined-csv

Use `api-parameters` fenced code plugin to document API parameters.

```
```api-parameters
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Nested
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#nested

Use `parent.child` syntax to define nested objects like this:

```
```api-parameters
sessionId, Integer, session Id
person, Person, person to login with
person.firstName, String, first name of the person
person.lastName, String, last name of the person
roles, List<Role>, list of authorized roles
roles.id, String, role id 
roles.description, String, role description
```
```

Note: when using this approach it is necessary to explicitly define a `root` entry, such as `person` in this example.


Note: if a parameter name actually contains a period ("."), you can prevent this nesting behavior by putting the parameter name in single quotes, e.g. "person.firstName"

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Title
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#title

Use the `title` parameter to specify a title.

```
```api-parameters {title: "person definition"}
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Collapsing Parameters
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#collapsing-parameters

Use `collapsed: true|false` to make `api-parameters` collapsible.

```markdown
```api-parameters {title: "address definition", anchorPrefix: "title", collapsed: true}
city, String, city name
zipCode, String, zip code
```
```


Note: `collapsed` requires `title` to be present

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: No Gap
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#no-gap

Use `noGap: true` to remove top/bottom margins when there are multiple parameter instances in a row.

```markdown
```api-parameters { title: "person definition", anchorPrefix: "title", collapsed: false, noGap: true }
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```

```api-parameters {title: "address definition", anchorPrefix: "title", collapsed: true}
city, String, city name
zipCode, String, zip code
```
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Size
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#size

Use the `small` parameter to render API Parameters using smaller font size and occupying less width

```
```api-parameters {small: true}
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Multi-line CSV Description
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#multi-line-csv-description

Use quotes `"` to wrap a multiline description. Here is an example of description including multiple lines and nested code block example.

```
`````api-parameters 
cores, String, "
```
execute(cores: 10)
```
Specify how many cores to allocate for execution
"

gpu, Boolean, "
```
execute(cores: 10, gpu: true)
```
Specify whether to use gpu
"
`````
```


Note: Use larger number of backticks on outside then inside to distinct between `api-parameters` plugin boundaries and nested code blocks

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: External JSON File
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#external-json-file

Instead of hard-coding your parameters inside markdown files, you can specify an external JSON file. JSON could be generated based on the data you have. Some examples:

- build time annotation processor
- test time command line parameters generation

```json
[
  {
    "name": "sessionId",
    "type": "Integer",
    "description": "session Id"
  },
  {
    "name": "person",
    "type": "Person",
    "description": "person to login with",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "firstName",
        "type": "String",
        "description": "*first* name of the person"
      },
      {
        "name": "lastName",
        "type": "String",
        "description": "*last* name of the person"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "roles",
    "type": "List<Role>",
    "description": "list of authorized roles",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "String",
        "description": " role id "
      },
      {
        "name": "description",
        "type": "String",
        "description": "role description"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Given the above file, use

```
:include-api-parameters: api-parameters.json {title: "Person Definition"}
```

to display it as API Parameters


Note: `description` field in JSON file is treated as Markdown

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Anchors
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#anchors

Each API parameter has an anchor associated with it. You need to hover over parameter name for it to appear. Use `anchorPrefix` parameter to avoid conflict of anchor ids when using the same API parameter names within a single page:

```
```api-parameters {anchorPrefix: "customPrefix"}
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
```


In the example above `customPrefix` is added to each parameter link.

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Long Parameter Names
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#long-parameter-names

Znai hard wraps long parameter names to leave more space to description.


Use `noWrap: true` to remove hard wrap enforcement

```
```api-parameters {anchorPrefix: "customPrefix", noWrap: true}
VERY_LONG_PARAMETER_NAME_WITHOUT_SPACES, String, description with *markdown* support
VERY_LONG_ANOTHER_PARAMETER_NAME_WITHOUT_SPACES, String, another description line with *markdown* support
```
```

# Snippets :: API Parameters :: Wide Mode
answer-link: znai/snippets/api-parameters#wide-mode

Use `wide: true` to use all the available horizontal space

```
```api-parameters {anchorPrefix: "customPrefix", noWrap: true, wide: true}
VERY_LONG_PARAMETER_NAME_WITHOUT_SPACES, String, "longer line longer line, description with *markdown* support"
VERY_LONG_ANOTHER_PARAMETER_NAME_WITHOUT_SPACES, String, "longer line longer line, another description 
line with *markdown* support and few moe lines"
```
```

# Snippets :: Code References :: Local References
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-references#local-references

You can turn parts of a code snippet into links to internal or external pages.

To do that, define references in a CSV file, using a two column format: `expression, link`.

```csv
constructor, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor
usefulAction, example-references/api#useful-action
```

```
:include-file: file-name.js {referencesPath: "references/references-demo.csv"}
```

```js
class JsClass {
    constructor() {
        usefulAction()
    }
}

export default JsClass
```

JSON format is also supported

```json
{
  "constructor": "https: //developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor",
  "usefulAction": "example-references/api#useful-action"
}
```

# Snippets :: Code References :: Page Defaults
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-references#page-defaults

Use plugin [Page Local Defaults](plugins/default-parameters#page-local-defaults) to set references file that is relevant to the page at hand.

# Snippets :: Code References :: Global References
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-references#global-references

Add references to `references.csv` or `references.json` if you want all your code snippets to use the same references.

```json
{
  "fapi.book": "example-references/api#book",
  "fapi.query": "example-references/api#query"
}
```

```js
import * as fapi from 'flight-api'

function bookFlight(flightInfo) {
    const confirmation = fapi.book(flightInfo)
    //...
}

function flightStatus(id) {
    const fullStatus = fapi.query(id)
    return fullStatus.shortStatus
}
```

# Snippets :: Code References :: Inlined Code
answer-link: znai/snippets/code-references#inlined-code

[Inlined code](snippets/inlined-code-snippets) is automatically converted into a link if its content matches one of the global references entries:

```md
Use `fapi.book` to book a flight.  
```

Use `fapi.book` to book a flight.

# Snippets :: Json :: Auto Formatting
answer-link: znai/snippets/json#auto-formatting

Comma-separated paths specified inside `paths` will be highlighted.

```
:include-xml: menu.html {paths: ["ul.@class", "ul.li[1].@class", "ul.li[2]"]}
```


Note: Children index in `paths` starts with 0 and is associated with a tag

```
:include-xml: simple.xml {paths: ["root.a[1]", "root.b[0]", "root.c[0]"]}
```

# Snippets :: Xml :: Use Cases

To bring attention to important parameters in your CLI examples use the `cli` fence plugin.

```
```cli {highlight: "important"}
my-super-command paramA --important-flag=true 
```
```

```cli
my-super-command paramA --important-flag=true
```

Note: Parameter names gets matched as long as their names contain the passed value.

```markdown
```cli {highlight: "important"}
my-super-command paramA --important-flag=true 
another-command stop  
```
```

```cli
my-super-command paramA --important-flag=true
another-command stop
```

# Snippets :: CLI :: Include Plugin

```

# Snippets :: CLI :: Long Commands
answer-link: znai/snippets/CLI#long-commands

Long command lines will be automatically wrapped into multiple lines.


Use `threshold` parameter to specify the max length of a line before splitting:

```
:include-cli-command: another-command --score=2 --name=Name --value=8 --long-parameter-test --another-long-parameter1 --another-long-parameter2 --another-long3 {
    highlight: ["name", "value"], 
    threshold: 30
}
```


Use `splitAfter` to force line splitting after specified parameter:

```
:include-cli-command: another-command --score=2 --name=Name --value=8 --long-parameter-test --another-long-parameter1 --another-long-parameter2 --another-long3 {
    highlight: ["name", "value"], 
    splitAfter: ["--score=2", "--value=8"]
}
```


Note: Unlike `highlight`, `splitAfter` must be an exact match

# Snippets :: CLI :: Handle Special Symbols
answer-link: znai/snippets/CLI#handle-special-symbols

If your command contains special symbols, such as `{`, move the command definition to a `command` option

```
:include-cli-command: {command: "another-command {file1} [file2]", highlight: ["file1"]}
```

# Snippets :: CLI :: From File
answer-link: znai/snippets/CLI#from-file

# Snippets :: Math :: LaTeX Block
answer-link: znai/snippets/math#latex-block

To render math you can use [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) math expressions. Surround LaTeX expression with fenced block and specify `latex` as a language

```
```latex
\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
```
```

The result will be a following math expression.


```
```latex
x = \begin{cases}
a &\text{if } b \\
c &\text{if } d \\
x &\text{if } z
\end{cases}
```
```


Alternatively surround a match expression with double dollar `$$` sign to render it into a latex block.

```markdown
Given: 
$$x=y$$ and $$y=z$$
```

# Snippets :: Jupyter Notebook :: Include Notebook Section
answer-link: znai/snippets/jupyter-notebook#include-notebook-section

Use `include-jupyter` to include a jupyter notebook or one of its parts. Here is an example of a notebook:


To include one of its sections use,

```
:include-jupyter: jupyter/notebook.ipynb {
    includeSection: ["Loading Data From CSV"]
}
```

Markdown cells will be seamlessly integrated with the current page. Top level headers become this page top level header.

Note: without `includeSection`, the entire notebook content will be added.

# Snippets :: Jupyter Notebook :: Loading Data From CSV
answer-link: znai/snippets/jupyter-notebook#loading-data-from-csv

Use `read_csv` to load data from an external file.

```python
from pandas import read_csv
from IPython.display import display

games = read_csv('games.csv')
print(games)
```

```csv
      genre       title  price
0       RPG   Witcher 3   20.0
1       FPS        Doom   39.0
2  Strategy   War Craft   10.0
3     Cards     Balatro    5.0
```

```python
display(games)
```


Note: Remember that you can define lookup paths for files like notebooks inside [lookup-paths](flow/lookup-paths) file, so you don't have to copy and paste notebooks to your documentation directory.

# Snippets :: Jupyter Notebook :: Exclude Section Title
answer-link: znai/snippets/jupyter-notebook#exclude-section-title

Use `excludeSectionTitle` to exclude section title. It can be useful when you want to use section titles as example separators to be included into your guides.

```
:include-jupyter: jupyter/notebook.ipynb {
    includeSection: ["Average Prcing By Genre"],
    excludeSectionTitle: true
}
```

To calculate the average prcing, use `groupby` and `mean` combination.

```python
games.groupby('genre')['price'].mean().plot(kind='bar', 
    title='Average Price by Genre',
    ylabel='Price ($)',
    rot=45)
```

```csv
<Axes: title={'center': 'Average Price by Genre'}, xlabel='genre', ylabel='Price ($)'>

# Snippets :: Groovy :: Method Body
answer-link: znai/snippets/groovy#method-body

When you need to extract a specific method body use the `include-groovy` plugin.

Consider the following file:


Specify a method name to extract it from the file.

```
:include-groovy: HelloWorldTest.groovy {entry: "should calculate risk based on epsilon", bodyOnly: true}
```

If `bodyOnly` is specified, signature will be omitted.

# Snippets :: Groovy :: Multiple Bodies
answer-link: znai/snippets/groovy#multiple-bodies

Pass `list` as `entry` to extract multiple method bodies

```markdown
:include-groovy: HelloWorldTest.groovy {
  title: "api example",
  entry: ["should calculate risk based on epsilon", "should calculate risk based on epsilon"],
  bodyOnly: true }
```


Pass `entrySeparator: "<separator>"` to have a provided line in between entries as a separator.

```markdown
:include-groovy: HelloWorldTest.groovy {
  title: "api example",
  entry: ["should calculate risk based on epsilon", "should calculate risk based on epsilon"],
  entrySeparator: "",
  bodyOnly: true }
```

# Snippets :: Groovy :: Overloads
answer-link: znai/snippets/groovy#overloads

Specify types inside brackets to select an overloaded versions of your methods.

Types should appear as they do in the file, i.e., if you use the short version of a type, you need to use the short version inside the plugin.


```
:include-groovy: HelloWorld.groovy {entry: "methodName(List, Map)"}
:include-groovy: HelloWorld.groovy {entry: "methodName(def,def)"}
```

Note: Generic types are erased and spaces after commas are optional


Note: `def` type remains `def` and not `Object`

# Snippets :: Groovy :: Class Body
answer-link: znai/snippets/groovy#class-body

```groovy
import your.company.com.util.*

/*
 groovy docs on top
 */
class HelloWorld {
    void methodName(List<String> a, Map<String, Integer> b) {
        actionA()
    }

    void methodName(List<String> a, Boolean b) {
        actionB()
    }

    void methodName(def a, def b) {
        actionC()
    }
}
```

To extract `class` body use:

```
:include-groovy: HelloWorld.groovy {entry: "HelloWorld"}
```


Use `bodyOnly` to only display only the body of your class.

```
:include-groovy: HelloWorld.groovy {entry: "HelloWorld", bodyOnly: true}
```

# Snippets :: Markdown :: Single Markdown File
answer-link: znai/snippets/markdown#single-markdown-file

To reuse Markdown in several places without duplication, use the `include-markdown` plugin.

```md
# Included Markdown

This markdown, and the sub-heading above, were included using the `include-markdown` plugin.
```

```
:include-markdown: markdown-dir/md-to-include.md
```

This markdown, and the sub-heading above, were included using the `include-markdown` plugin.

# Snippets :: Markdown :: Optional Markdown
answer-link: znai/snippets/markdown#optional-markdown

When you document an open source project you may have different instructions based on where the documentation is deployed.

For example, this documentation has two versions, one deployed internally at Two Sigma and one deployed externally using GitHub Pages. Most of the documentation parts are the same, but there are differences in sections like *Getting Started*.

We build documentation twice and the differences are handled by `include-markdown`'s `firstAvailable` parameter.

```
:include-markdown: {firstAvailable: [
    "markdown-dir/getting-started-step-internal.md", 
    "markdown-dir/getting-started-step-external.md"]}
```

```cli
command specific-to-external
```

# Snippets :: Markdown :: Partial Markdown
answer-link: znai/snippets/markdown#partial-markdown

Use `surroundedBy` to include portion of a markdown from existing markdown file, e.g. `readme.md`

Given an existing markdown files with markers

```md
# Section One

Some text

# Section Two

[comment]: <> (marker-one)

Use these parameters to setup your work environment:
```
parameter=value
```

[comment]: <> (marker-one)
```

```markdown
:include-markdown: markdown-dir/markdown-with-markers.md {surroundedBy: "<> (marker-one)"}
```

Use these parameters to setup your work environment:

```
parameter=value
```

# Snippets :: Markdown :: Inlined Markdown
answer-link: znai/snippets/markdown#inlined-markdown

To inline a piece of markdown use the inlined version of the plugin

```
content `:markdown: path-to-file.md` content
```

Plugin will inline text content into current paragraph.

```markdown
Use the latest version `:markdown: markdown-dir/inlined.md` to get the feature.
```

```md
`:badge: 2.34`
```

Use the latest version 

 to get the feature.

Use `firstAvailable` parameter to include first file that can be resolved

```markdown
Use the latest version `:markdown: {
  firstAvailable: ["markdown-dir/inlined-alternative.md", "markdown-dir/inlined.md"]}` to get the feature.
```


Use the latest version 

 to get the feature.

# Snippets :: Markdown :: Multiple Markdown Files
answer-link: znai/snippets/markdown#multiple-markdown-files

You can also include all the Markdown files within a directory by using `include-markdowns`.

This plugin can be used to generate release notes or an FAQ page.

# Visuals :: Cards :: Image And Title
answer-link: znai/visuals/cards#image-and-title

Use `card` fenced block plugin to render a card.

```markdown
```card books.jpg {title: "My Card"}
Markdown content of the card goes here
* item one

* item three
```
```


Note: Card scales down large image to fit

# Visuals :: Cards :: Image Height And Background
answer-link: znai/visuals/cards#image-height-and-background

When you use icon like images, e.g. SVGs, then they will take all the horizontal available space, and it may not be ideal.

Use `imageHeight` to force image height. Use `imageBackground` to specify a [background color/gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp).

```markdown
```card diamond.svg {title: "My Card", imageHeight: 120, imageBackground: "linear-gradient(to right, rgb(29 41 41), rgb(145, 152, 229))"}
Markdown content of the card goes here
* item one
* item two
* item three
```
```

# Visuals :: Cards :: Multiple Columns
answer-link: znai/visuals/cards#multiple-columns

Use [Colums](layout/columns) to arrange cards side by side


```markdown
```````columns
left:
```card diamond.svg {title: "Card Title", imageHeight: 120, imageBackground: "linear-gradient(to right, rgb(29 41 41), rgb(145, 152, 229))"}
Markdown content goes here

:include-file: snippets/file-name.js 
```

middle:
```card small-book.png {title: "Book", imageHeight: 120}
Markdown content of the card goes here
* item one
* item two
* item three
```

right:
`````card star.svg {title: "API for the Win", imageHeight: 120, imageBackground: "linear-gradient(to right, rgb(154 128 145 / 0%), rgb(255 206 206))"}
Easy to use API
```api-parameters
firstName, String, description with *markdown* support
score, Integer, another description line with *markdown* support
```
`````
````````
```

Note: Card plugin is designed to work with [code snippets](snippets/external-code-snippets), [Tables](layout/tables) and [API Parameters](snippets/api-parameters) by reducing spacing and integrating borders

# Visuals :: Cards :: Links
answer-link: znai/visuals/cards#links

Card plugin automatically converts links at the end of the fenced block content into dedicated card links.


```markdown

# Visuals :: SVG :: Actual Size
answer-link: znai/visuals/SVG#actual-size

SVGs may have additional white space around the content and have width and height property specified inside. Use `actualSize: true` if you want to use the actual content only and effectively crop the white space. `width` and `height` will be overridden with the cropped size.

```
:include-svg: with-groups.svg {idsToReveal: ["partC"], actualSize: true}
```


Without `actualSize` there would be a gap created by hiding other parts.

# Visuals :: SVG :: Scale
answer-link: znai/visuals/SVG#scale

Use `scale: scaleFactor` to change the size of the SVG provided

```
:include-svg: with-groups.svg {idsToReveal: ["partC"], actualSize: true, scale: 0.2}
```

# Visuals :: SVG :: Fit
answer-link: znai/visuals/SVG#fit

Use `fit: true` to automatically scale down wide SVGs to fit within the available content width. This is useful for diagrams that are designed to be wide but need to adapt to different screen sizes.

```
:include-svg: wide-boxes.svg {fit: true}
```


Without `fit`, the SVG would overflow the content area on narrow screens.

# Visuals :: Icons :: Feather Icons
answer-link: znai/visuals/icons#feather-icons

# Visuals :: Flow Diagrams :: Nodes and Edges
answer-link: znai/visuals/flow-diagrams#nodes-and-edges



Specify a `JSON` file to define a flow chart.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "input one"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",
      "label": "input two"
    },
    {
      "id": "n3",

      "label": "output two"
    },
    {
      "id": "n6",
      "label": "output three"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    ["n1", "n3"],
    ["n2", "n3"],
    ["n3", "n4"],
    ["n3", "n5"],
    ["n3", "n6"]
  ]
}
```

At the minimum `edges` must be provided.

```
:include-flow-chart: simple-dag.json
```

# Visuals :: Flow Diagrams :: Multiline Labels
answer-link: znai/visuals/flow-diagrams#multiline-labels

Use `\n` to split your label into multiple lines.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "input\none"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",
      "label": "output\ntwo"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    ["n1", "n2"]
  ]
}
```

# Visuals :: Flow Diagrams :: Nodes Size
answer-link: znai/visuals/flow-diagrams#nodes-size

Add `config` section to specify a common size for all the nodes

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "one"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",
      "label": "two"
    },
    {
      "id": "n3",
      "label": "three"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    [
      "n1",
      "n2"
    ],
    [
      "n2",
      "n3"
    ],
    [
      "n1",

  ],
  "config": {
    "nodes": {
      "width": 1.5,
      "height": 1.5
    }
  }
}
```


Note: Size unit is not based on pixels. It is sized in inches (assuming correct DPI). It is the size units used by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/))

Use `width` and `height` property on a node itself to control individual nodes size:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "one"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",

    },
    {
      "id": "n3",
      "label": "three",
      "width": 2,
      "height": 2
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    [
      "n1",
      "n2"
    ],
    [

    {
      "id": "n1",
      "label": "label 1"
    },
    {
      "id": "n2",
      "label": "label 2",
      "highlight": true
    },
    {

Use `highlight` to highlight a node.


Or use `highlight` property of a `flow-chart` include plugin.

```
:include-flow-chart: simple-dag.json {highlight: "n3"}
```


Note: To highlight more than one element use `{highlight: ["n3", "n4"]}`

# Visuals :: Iframe :: Embedding Supporting Content
answer-link: znai/visuals/iframe#embedding-supporting-content

Use `include-iframe` plugin to embed HTML content that supports your documentation. Some examples:

- generated React JS index.html with components that get rendered based on url anchor
- custom plot functions

```markdown
:include-iframe: iframe/custom.html {
  fit: true
}
```


Note: Use `fit` parameter to automatically set the height of the iframe to fit its content

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <style>
      :root {
          --backgroundColor: #eee;
          --color: #222;
      }

          color: var(--color);
          font-size: 20px;
          padding: 16px;
      }
  </style>
  <title>generated content</title>
</head>

<body>
<div class="content">Custom content</div>
</body>
</html>
```

# Visuals :: Iframe :: Properties Override
answer-link: znai/visuals/iframe#properties-override

Use `light` and `dark` to override CSS properties inside iframe content for light and dark modes respectively. Switch mode now to see the effect.

```markdown
:include-iframe: iframe/custom.html {
  fit: true,
  light: { "--color": "#333", "--backgroundColor": "#eee" },
  dark: { "--color": "#eee", "--backgroundColor": "#333" },
}
```

# Visuals :: Iframe :: Title
answer-link: znai/visuals/iframe#title

Use `title` parameter to display title bar on top of the embedded content:

```markdown
:include-iframe: iframe/custom.html {
  title: "rendered example",
  light: { "--color": "#333", "--backgroundColor": "#eee" },
  dark: { "--color": "#eee", "--backgroundColor": "#333" },
  fit: true
}
```

# Visuals :: Iframe :: Height
answer-link: znai/visuals/iframe#height

Use `height` to force container height. Use `maxHeight` to limit the automatically calculated height.

# Visuals :: Iframe :: Embedding Video
answer-link: znai/visuals/iframe#embedding-video

Use `include-iframe` to embed media from other places. By default, aspect ratio is set to `16:9`.

# Layout :: Tabs :: Primary Use Case
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#primary-use-case

Imagine your product supports multiple ways of achieving a final result:

- REST
- Web
- CLI
- Java
- Python
- more...

You can use tabs to allow your user to choose the method to accomplish the goal covered in the documentation. Tab selections will persist for users and provide streamlined experience.

Don't: use tabs as navigation experience. If your user needs both `Java` and `Python` executed one by one you need to show steps one after the other in proper order.

# Layout :: Tabs :: Definition
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#definition

To define multiple tabs we use fenced code block:

```
```tabs
JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java
Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
```
```

This will generate a multi-tab widget with `include-` plugin content for each tab.


Selecting a tab will switch all the tabs on every page.

# Layout :: Tabs :: Markdown Per Tab
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#markdown-per-tab

Any valid Markdown can be used in place of `include-` content.

A typical use case for *installation instructions* might be dividing content per language or environment:

```
````tabs
JavaScript: 
First you need to download WebStorm and then run the following using your terminal

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
    
Java: 
First you need to download Intellij IDEA and then run the following using your terminal
    
```bash
$ mvn install
$ mvn exec:exec
```
    
Cpp: 
First you need to download CLion and then run the following using your terminal

```bash
$ pwd
$ whoamis
```
````
```

# Layout :: Tabs :: Separate Markdown Files
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#separate-markdown-files

Consider extracting content to separate markup files if content becomes long. Use the `include-markdown` plugin to include external content.

```
```tabs
JavaScript: :include-markdown: instructions/javascript-install.md
Java: :include-markdown: instructions/java-install.md
Cpp: :include-markdown: instructions/cpp-install.md
```
```

Each tab will display inlined markdown from specified files.

# Layout :: Tabs :: Default Tab
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#default-tab

Use `default: "tab name"` to set which tab will be initially active. First Tab is active otherwise.

# Layout :: Tabs :: Attention Signs
answer-link: znai/layout/tabs#attention-signs

Use extra space(s) in front of `Note:` or other attention sign keywords to put attention signs inside a tab. Remember if you put 4+ spaces, your paragraph will become a code snippet.

```
````tabs
JavaScript: 

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

 Avoid: committing node_modules
    
Java: 
First you need to download Intellij IDEA and then run the following using your terminal
    
```bash
$ mvn install
$ mvn exec:exec
```
    
 Warning: `mvn` install for the first time may take considerable amount of time

Cpp: 
First you need to download CLion and then run the following using your terminal

```bash
$ pwd
$ whoamis
```

 Question: is C++ awesome or what?

# Layout :: Tables :: CSV
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#csv

Instead of aligning tables using one of the standard Markdown extensions, you can use your `CSV` editor of choice.

```
:include-table: table.csv 
```

In this way, the following `CSV` file...

```csv
Account, Price, Description
#12BGD3, 100, custom table with a long attachment
#12BGD4, 90, custom table with a short attachment
#12BGD5, 150, chair
#91AGB1, 10, lunch
```

...will render like so:

# Layout :: Tables :: JSON
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#json

This extension can be used to display data from a `JSON` file representing tabular data.

```
:include-table: table.json 
```

So the following `JSON` file...

```json
[
  {
    "Account": "#12BGD3",
    "Price": 100,
    "Description": "custom table with a long attachment"
  },
  {
    "Account": "#12BGD3",
    "Price": 150,
    "Description": "chair"
  },
  {
    "Account": "#91AGB1",
    "Price": 10,
    "Description": "lunch"
  }
]
```

...will render like so:

# Layout :: Tables :: Title
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#title

Use `title` parameter to set a table title.

```
:include-table: table.json {title: "Monthly Report"}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Anchor
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#anchor

When you specify a title, hover mouse over it to see a clickable anchor.

Use `anchorId` to override auto generated identifier.

```
:include-table: table/table.json {title: "Monthly Report", anchorId: "my-super-table"}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Collapse
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#collapse

Use `collapsed: true|false` to make image collapsible. Note: `title` option is required

```markdown
:include-table: table/table.json {
  title: "Monthly Report",
  collapsed: true
}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: No Gap
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#no-gap

Use `noGap: true` to remove top/bottom margins when there are multiple tables in a row.

```markdown
:include-table: table/table.json {
  title: "Monthly Report",
  collapsed: true,
  noGap: true
}

:include-table: table/table.json {
  title: "Weekly Report",
  collapsed: false
}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Highlight
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#highlight

Use `highlightRow` to highlight a row, or a set of rows by their index

```
:include-table: table/table.json {title: "Highlight multiple rows", highlightRow: [0, 2]}
```


```
:include-table: table/table.json {title: "Highlight single row", highlightRow: 1}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Arrange and Remove Columns
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#arrange-and-remove-columns

```


Use  to exclude rows that match a regular expression

```
:include-table: table/table.csv {includeRowsRegexp: ["table", "cha.."], excludeRowsRegexp: "short"}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Width
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#width

By default, columns width is auto-calculated to fit the values inside. Use `width` to control the width of a column.

```
:include-table: table.csv {Price: {width: 200}, "Description": {width: 400}}
```


Use percentage value to change column size relative to the page content width.

```
:include-table: table/table.csv {Price: {width: "50%"}, "Description": {width: "30%"}}
```


Note: total percentage of all columns can go above 100%, in which case a scroll bar will be used to fit the content

```
:include-table: table/table.csv {Price: {width: "50%"}, "Description": {width: "60%"}}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Column Names Conflict
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#column-names-conflict

Use `_` prefix if a column name matches the plugin parameter name like `title` when setting column specific parameters.

```
:include-table: table/table-conflict.csv {"_title": {width: "80%"}}
```

# Layout :: Tables :: Min Width
answer-link: znai/layout/tables#min-width

Note: request and response were automatically captured using [WebTau](synergy-with-testing/REST-API) testing framework.

We need to document other methods as well, and as you can imagine, the repetition will take place.

# Layout :: Templates :: Extract A Pattern
answer-link: znai/layout/templates#extract-a-pattern

Let's move a block we plan to repeat into a separate file and replace hardcoding of entries like **post** with placeholders. Znai uses the [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org) template engine.

```md
:include-groovy: org/testingisdocumenting/testing/examples/restapi/WebTauRestAPIGroovyTest.groovy {
  title: "${method?upper_case} messages",
  entry: "${method}Messages",
  bodyOnly: true,

# Layout :: Two Sides Pages :: Setup
answer-link: znai/layout/two-sides-pages#setup

To enable two-sided layout as seen on this page, add the following at the beginning of a Markdown file:

```markdown
---
type: two-sides
---
```

# Layout :: Two Sides Pages :: Details Side
answer-link: znai/layout/two-sides-pages#details-side

Use the right pane to display additional details. It could be a REST response or a code snippet.

Use `include-meta` in front of some content to place it on the right side of the page. All the following content will go to the right side. At the start of a new section it will be reset.

```markdown
:include-open-api: snippets/open-api/uber.json {method: "get", path: "/v1/estimates/time"}
:include-meta: {rightSide: true}
:include-json: two-sides/price-estimate.json

```

Use `rightSide: true` as a parameter to `include-` plugins to move result to the right side.

```md
# Single Data Block Shortcut

:include-table: layout/table/table.csv
:include-file: layout/table/table.csv {rightSide: true}
```

# Layout :: Two Sides Pages :: Aligning Data in Columns
answer-link: znai/layout/two-sides-pages#aligning-data-in-columns

Use an `include-empty-block` to align code snippets or other data block on both sides when there is an extra text on either side.



```csv
Account, Price, Description
#12BGD3, 100, custom table with a long attachment
#12BGD4, 90, custom table with a short attachment
#12BGD5, 150, chair
#91AGB1, 10, lunch
```

Table and code snippets above are aligned by using an empty block on the right side.

```markdown
:include-empty-block: {rightSide: true}

:include-table: layout/table/table.csv
:include-file: layout/table/table.csv {rightSide: true}
```

# Layout :: Two Sides Tabs :: Unified Tabs
answer-link: znai/layout/two-sides-tabs#unified-tabs

In two sides layout tabs selection is moved to a single place (default is top right panel).

# Layout :: Two Sides Tabs :: Definition
answer-link: znai/layout/two-sides-tabs#definition

To define multiple tabs we use fenced code block

```
```tabs
JavaScript: :include-file: snippets/file-name.js
Java: :include-file: snippets/WideCode.java 
Cpp: :include-cpp: snippets/simple.cpp {entry: 'main', bodyOnly: true}
```
```

This will generate a multi-tab widget with an include plugin content per tab.

Note: Selecting a tab will switch all the tabs on every page.

# Layout :: Two Sides Tabs :: Markdown Per Tab

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Content
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#content

Note: Function Content support requires running znai in an environment with Python 3.8 or later.

All the examples below are from the following example Python file:

```py
my_var = "a variable"

def my_func(p1, p2):
    """
    text inside my *func* doc
    * list one
    * list two

    Parameters
    ----------
    p1: String
        parameter one description
    p2: String
        parameter two description
    """

    return 2 + 2

class Animal:
    """
    animal top level class doc string

    ```
    code block
    ```
    """

    def says(self):
        """
        animal **talks** `code`
        """
        print("hello")
```

Use `include-python` plugin to extract function, class or global variable content.

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Function
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#function

To show the full contents of a function:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "Animal.says"}
```


This also works for global functions:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "my_func"}
```


To show a function's body, without signature or doc string:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "Animal.says", bodyOnly: true}
```


This also works for global functions:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "my_func", bodyOnly: true}
```

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Title
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#title

Use the `title` property to specify an extracted snippet title.

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "Animal.says", bodyOnly: true, title: "extracted snippet"}
```

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Anchor
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#anchor

Use `anchorId` to make a code snippet linkable. Hover mouse over title to see a clickable anchor.

```
:include-python: python/example.py {
  entry: "Animal.says", 
  bodyOnly: true,
  title: "extracted snippet",
  anchorId: "my-extracted-snippet"
}
```

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Variable
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#variable

To show a variable's definition and assignment:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "my_var"}
```


To show only a variable's value:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "my_var", bodyOnly: true}
```

# Python :: Content Extraction :: Class
answer-link: znai/python/content-extraction#class

To show the full class definition:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "Animal"}
```


To show the contents of a class without the class declaration or doc string:

```
:include-python: python/example.py {entry: "Animal", bodyOnly: true}
```

# Python :: Description Extraction :: Doc String
answer-link: znai/python/description-extraction#doc-string

Use `include-python-doc` plugin to embed py doc string with markdown into documentation. Znai uses [Pandas style doc string](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_docstring.html) to parse description and parameters.

```py
my_var = "a variable"

def my_func(p1, p2):
    """
    text inside my *func* doc
    * list one
    * list two

    Parameters
    ----------
    p1: String
        parameter one description
    p2: String
        parameter two description
    """

    return 2 + 2

class Animal:
    """
    animal top level class doc string

    ```
    code block
    ```
    """

    def says(self):
        """
        animal **talks** `code`
        """
        print("hello")
```

```
:include-python-doc: python/example.py {entry: "my_func"}
```


Note: Plugin ignores parameters block and only includes the description text. Check next section to see how to include parameters

```
:include-python-doc: python/example.py {entry: "Animal"}
```


```
:include-python-doc: python/example.py {entry: "Animal.says"}
```

# Python :: Description Extraction :: Doc Parameters
answer-link: znai/python/description-extraction#doc-parameters

Use `include-python-doc-params` plugin to render parameters extracted from pydoc text

```py
def my_func(label, price):
    """
    text inside my *func* doc
    * list one
    * list two

    Parameters
    ----------
    label : str
      label to use to *render* item in the store

    price : fin.money.Money
      price associated with the **item**

    Returns
    -------
    str
      status of the operation

      `OK` for good
    """

    return "OK"
```

```
:include-python-doc-params: python/pydoc-params.py {entry: "my_func", title: "result and parameters"}
```


Note: read more about [API parameters](snippets/api-parameters) for additional properties

# Python :: Description Extraction :: Type Hints
answer-link: znai/python/description-extraction#type-hints

If you define [Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), you can omit types from PyDoc text and Znai will take the types from the signature

```py
import fin

def my_func(label: str, price: fin.money.Money) -> str:
    """
    text inside my *func* doc
    * list one
    * list two

    Parameters
    --------------
    label :
      label to use to *render* item in the store

    price :
      price associated with the **item**

    Returns
    -------
      status of the operation

      `OK` for good
    """

    return "OK"
```

```
:include-python-doc-params: python/pydoc-params-type-hints.py {entry: "my_func", title: "result and parameters"}
```

# Python :: Auto Reference :: Method/Function Definition
answer-link: znai/python/auto-reference#method-function-definition

Use `python-method` to include function/method definition with signature, documentation and parameters list

```
:include-python-method: fin.money.render_money
```


```py
def render_money(amount: Money, message: str = "") -> str:
    """
    render money to a string

    Parameters

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Method Body
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#method-body

When you need to extract a specific method body, use the `include-java` plugin.

Consider the file below:


You can specify a method name to extract its full definition, or display only its body.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", bodyOnly: true}
```

If `bodyOnly` is specified, signature will be omitted.

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Callout Comments
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#callout-comments

Similar to how you [specify comments type](snippets/code-comments#callout-comments) for a regular file, you can specify `commentsType` option for `include-java`.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", bodyOnly: true, commentsType: "inline"}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Title
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#title

Use `title` property to specify extracted code snippet title

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", bodyOnly: true, title: "my snippet"}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Anchor
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#anchor

Use `anchorId` to make a code snippet linkable. Hover mouse over title to see a clickable anchor.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {
  entry: "sampleMethod",
  bodyOnly: true,
  title: "my snippet",
  anchorId: "my-java-snippet"
}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Signature Only
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#signature-only

You can also specify a method name and extract only its signature.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", signatureOnly: true}
```

If `signatureOnly` is specified, body will be omitted.


Pass `entrySeparator: "<separator>"` to have a provided line in between entries as a separator.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", signatureOnly: true, entrySeparator: "..."}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Overloads
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#overloads

Specify types inside brackets to select an overloaded versions of your methods.

Types should appear as they are in the file, i.e., if you use the short version of a type, you need to use the short version inside the plugin.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod(Map, int, boolean)"}
```

Note: Generic types are erased and spaces after commas are optional

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Type Body
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#type-body

To extract `class`, `interface` or `enum` body use:

```
:include-java: MyEnum.java {entry: "MyEnum"}
```


Use `bodyOnly` to only display body of your type.

```
:include-java: MyEnum.java {entry: "MyEnum", bodyOnly: true}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Multiple Entries
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#multiple-entries

To display multiple methods at once pass a list to `entry` parameter

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: ["createData", "importantAction"]}
```

This will render:


List important methods signatures at one place by passing `signatureOnly: true`.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: ["createData", "importantAction"], signatureOnly: true}
```

This will render:

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Multiple Overloads
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#multiple-overloads

To list of the overloads of a method, specify method name using the `entry` parameter.

```
:include-java: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod", signatureOnly: true}
```

# Java :: Content Extraction :: Multiple Bodies
answer-link: znai/java/content-extraction#multiple-bodies

Pass multiple entries and `bodyOnly` to extract example of usage from unit tests

```java
public class HelloWorldTest {
    @Test
    public void exampleOfA() {
        a.action();
    }

    @Test
    public void exampleOfB() {
        b.action();
    }
}
```

```
:include-java: HelloWorldTest.java {
  entry: ["exampleOfA", "exampleOfB"],
  bodyOnly: true,
  title: "example of actions"}
```


Pass `entrySeparator: "<separator>"` to have a provided line in between entries as a separator.

```markdown
:include-java: HelloWorldTest.java {
  entry: ["exampleOfA", "exampleOfB"],
  entrySeparator: "",
  bodyOnly: true,
  title: "example of actions"}
```

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Class Level
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#class-level

Documentation maintenance is one of the main goals of this documentation system. In the case of Java you may already use `JavaDoc` strings to explain certain concepts of your system.


Instead of copy-and-pasting text between sources, you can refer to it inside your documentation.

```
:include-java-doc: HelloWorld.java
```

*Text bellow is extracted from top class level `JavaDoc`*

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Method Level
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#method-level

Method level `JavaDoc` text can be referred to as well by specifying the `entry` parameter.

```
:include-java-doc: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod"}
```

*Text bellow is extracted from `sampleMethod` method `JavaDoc`*

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Field Level
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#field-level

```
:include-java-doc: HelloWorld.java {entry: "numberOfStudents"}
```

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Inner Classes
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#inner-classes

Use `NestedName.entityName` to disambiguate a field or a method name


```
:include-java-doc: HelloWorldWithInner.java {entry: "Nested.importantScore"}
```

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Handling Links
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#handling-links

Links defined with `{@link MyClass}` are automatically converted to [Inlined Code](snippets/inlined-code-snippets) and become `MyClass`. To turn `MyClass` into a link you need to use [Code References](snippets/code-references).

Use the `referencesPath` value to associate `{@link CustomDomain}` with the documentation link:


```csv
CustomDomain, example-references/domain
Trader, example-references/domain#trader
Transaction, example-references/domain#transaction
BUY, example-references/domain#transaction-buy
SELL, example-references/domain#transaction-sell
```

Alternatively you can define [Global References](snippets/code-references#global-references) to turn `MyClass` into a link.

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Method Params
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#method-params

```
:include-java-doc-params: HelloWorld.java {entry: "sampleMethod"}
```


Use the `title` parameter to specify a title.

```
:include-java-doc-params: HelloWorld.java {entry: "importantAction", title: "Trading Required Parameters"}
```

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Method Params With References
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#method-params-with-references

Use the [Code References](snippets/code-references) file to link method parameters to reference pages.

To do that, define references in a CSV file, using a two column format: `type-or-variable-name, link`.

```csv
CustomDomain, example-references/domain
Trader, example-references/domain#trader
Transaction, example-references/domain#transaction
BUY, example-references/domain#transaction-buy
SELL, example-references/domain#transaction-sell
```

```
:include-java-doc-params: HelloWorld.java {
    entry: "importantAction", 
    title: "Trading Required Parameters",
    referencesPath: "references/javadoc-references-demo.csv"}
```


Parameters are now linked with a reference section for the documentation.

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Enum Entries
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#enum-entries

Use `include-java-enum-entries` to enumerate entries of a enum from a file.

```java
package my.company;

enum MyEnum {
    /**
     * description of <b>entry one</b>
     */
    ENTRY_ONE,

    /**
     * description of entry two
     * <ul>
     *     <li>item one</li>
     *     <li>item two</li>
     * </ul>
     */
    ENTRY_TWO,

    /**
     * Don't use, instead use ENTRY_TWO
     */
    @Deprecated
    ENTRY_THREE
}
```

```
:include-java-enum-entries: MyEnum.java
```


You can exclude deprecated entries from the list by setting the `excludeDeprecated` parameter.

```
:include-java-enum-entries: MyEnum.java {excludeDeprecated: true}
```


Use the `title` parameter to specify a title.

```
:include-java-enum-entries: TransactionTypes.java {title: "Transaction Types"}
```

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Enum Entries With References
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#enum-entries-with-references

Use a [Code References](snippets/code-references) file to link enum entries to reference pages.

To do that, define references in a CSV file, using a two column format: `enum-name, link`.

```csv
CustomDomain, example-references/domain
Trader, example-references/domain#trader
Transaction, example-references/domain#transaction
BUY, example-references/domain#transaction-buy
SELL, example-references/domain#transaction-sell
```

```java
package my.company;

enum TransactionTypes {
    /**
     * buy intrument
     */
    BUY,

    /**
     * sell instrument
     */
    SELL
}
```

```
:include-java-enum-entries: TransactionTypes.java {
    title: "Transaction Types",
    referencesPath: "references/javadoc-references-demo.csv"
}
```


Enums are now linked with a reference section for the documentation.

Note: you can reuse the same CSV file for Enums, Parameters, Code Snippets. Alternatively, you can use [Global References](snippets/code-references#global-references).

# Java :: Description Extraction :: Markdown
answer-link: znai/java/description-extraction#markdown

Pass `markdown: true` parameter to the plugins to treat JavaDoc content as markdown

```java
/**
 * Top level **conceptual** description of a `CustomDomain` problem.
 * * markdown *list*
 * * item two
 * ```
 * code snippet
 * goes here
 * ```
 */
class HelloWorld {
}
```

```
:include-java-doc: HelloWorld.java {markdown: true}
```

# Java :: Auto Reference :: Coming Soon

# Synergy With Testing :: Web UI :: Screenshots And Annotations
answer-link: znai/synergy-with-testing/web-UI#screenshots-and-annotations

In [Image Annotations](visuals/image-annotations) you can specify annotations in an external file.

Using a testing framework one can generate coordinates during a UI test based on elements' placement. Here is an example of using [WebTau](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/webtau) testing framework to capture a screenshot and annotations

```groovy
package webtauexamples

import static org.testingisdocumenting.webtau.WebTauGroovyDsl.*

def homeSearchInput = $('input[class*="searchbox_input"], input[class*="search-input"]')
def resultSearchInput = $("#search_form_input")
def result = $('article[data-testid="result"]')

scenario("capture screenshot") {
    browser.open("https://duckduckgo.com/")

    homeSearchInput.waitToBe visible
    homeSearchInput.setValue("testing is documenting")
    homeSearchInput.sendKeys(browser.keys.enter)

    result.waitTo visible

    browser.doc.withAnnotations(resultSearchInput, result)
            .capture("duckduckgo-search")
}
```

```markdown
1. Type question you want to be answered anonymously
2. Scan through results and pick the most relevant one

:include-image: doc-artifacts/duckduckgo-search.png {annotate: true}
```

- Type question you want to be answered anonymously
- Scan through results and pick the most relevant one


```json

    "text" : "1",
    "x" : 375,
    "y" : 42,
    "align" : "Center"
  }, {
    "type" : "badge",
    "text" : "2",
    "x" : 367,
    "y" : 230,

# Synergy With Testing :: REST API :: Request and Response Capture
answer-link: znai/synergy-with-testing/REST-API#request-and-response-capture

[Open API](snippets/open-API) helps to define a formal API specification. And real examples of request/response helps to clarify.

Instead of manually copy-and-pasting the responses to your documentation, consider running tests and automatically capturing the relevant artifacts.

# Synergy With Testing :: REST API :: WebTau
answer-link: znai/synergy-with-testing/REST-API#webtau

[WebTau](https://testingisdocumenting.org/webtau) (short for web test automation) is a testing API, command line tool and a framework to write unit, integration and end-to-end tests. Test across REST-API, Graph QL, Browser, Database, CLI and Business Logic with consistent set of matchers and concepts.

Here is an example of REST API test with test artifacts capture

```groovy
scenario("create and access employee") {
    def id = http.post("/employee", [firstName: 'FN', lastName: 'LN']) {
        id.shouldNot == ""
        return id
    }
    http.doc.capture('employee-post') // capture previous HTTP call into <docDir>/employee-post

    http.get("/employee/$id") {
        firstName.should == "FN"
        lastName.should == "LN"
    }
    http.doc.capture('employee-get') // capture previous HTTP call into <docDir>/employee-get
}
```

# Synergy With Testing :: REST API :: Documentation Pipeline
answer-link: znai/synergy-with-testing/REST-API#documentation-pipeline

Documentation pipeline can look like


```markdown
# Create Employee

:include-open-api: openapi/api-spec.json {operationId: "createEmployee" }

```columns
left: 
:include-json: doc-artifacts/employee-post/request.json { title: "request payload" }

right: 
:include-json: doc-artifacts/employee-post/response.json {

# Synergy With Testing :: Business Logic :: Capture Input Example
answer-link: znai/synergy-with-testing/business-logic#capture-input-example

Your business logic tests can greatly improve maintainability of your documentation. The example below tests what account types are allowed to perform *Trading Activities*.

Test is using [WebTau](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/webtau) testing framework to define and capture test data.

```groovy
package org.testingisdocumenting.testing.examples

import org.junit.Test
import org.testingisdocumenting.webtau.data.table.TableData

import static org.testingisdocumenting.webtau.WebTauCore.*

class TestToDocExample {
    @Test
    void shouldRestrictAccountsActivity() {
        def rules = ["Account Type" | "Operation"    | "Restriction"] {
                    _________________________________________________
                        "SPB3"      | "Buy Options"  | "weekends only"
                        "TR"        | "Sell Futures" | "except holidays"
                        "BOSS"      | "Buy Stocks"   | "none" }

        validateRules(rules)
    }

    private static void validateRules(TableData rules) {
        doc.capture("account-rules", rules) // capture table data as JSON
    }
}
```

As part of validation of account types, the test also captures data that was used for testing. We can refer to this data later in our documentation by using the [include-table](layout/tables) plugin

```
:include-table: account-rules.json
```

Your test data and user-facing documentation is now linked.

# Plugins :: Plugin Types
answer-link: znai/plugins/plugin-types

`Znai` extends markdown with plugins system to supercharge visuals and maintainability. Three categories of plugins are available for usage and creation:

- [Include Plugins](#include-plugins)
- [Inlined Code](#inlined-code)
- [Fenced Block](#fenced-block)

# Plugins :: Plugin Types :: Include Plugins
answer-link: znai/plugins/plugin-types#include-plugins

To use include plugin write following on a new line

```
:include-<pluginId>: [text param] [{key1: value1, key2: value2}]
```

```markdown
:include-json: example.json {
  title: "JSON example",
  highlightValue: ["root.person.id"],
  collapsedPaths: ["root.details"]
}
```

```json
{
  "person": {
    "id": "pid1",
    "name": "Person Name"
  },
  "details": {
    "extra": "info"
  }
}
```

```markdown
:include-java: ../java/HelloWorld.java {
  entry: "sampleMethod", 
  bodyOnly: true,
  commentsType: "inline"
}
```

# Plugins :: Plugin Types :: Inlined Code
answer-link: znai/plugins/plugin-types#inlined-code

To use inlined code write plugin id inside backticks (`) surrounded with (:)

```markdown
content `:<pluginId>: [text param] [{key1: value1, key2: value2}]`
```

```markdown
It is a `:icon: cloud` day, `:icon: clock` is ticking
```

It is a  day,  is ticking

# Plugins :: Plugin Types :: Fenced Block
answer-link: znai/plugins/plugin-types#fenced-block

To use fenced block plugin specify its ids after fenced block start

```markdown
```<pluginId> [text param] [{key1: value1, key2: value2}]
content
```
```

```markdown
```tabs
C++: 
    content of C++ tab
Java:
    content of Java tab
Python:
    content of Python tab
```
```

# Plugins :: Default Parameters :: Global Defaults
answer-link: znai/plugins/default-parameters#global-defaults

Create `plugin-params.json` file to specify default parameters per plugin.

```json
{
  "api-parameters": {
    "title": "no title (set explicitly to override)"
  }
}
```

When the parameters file is present, any time you use [API Parameters](snippets/api-parameters) plugin without `title`, an implicit title will be present

# Plugins :: Default Parameters :: Page Local Defaults
answer-link: znai/plugins/default-parameters#page-local-defaults

Use page meta block at the start of a page to set plugin default parameters specific to the page.

You may have seen meta block example to set [Page Title](flow/names):

```
---
title: Custom Name
---
```

Now we're going to use the same block to add plugin defaults local to the page.

```md
---
image: {border: true}
---
```

Once we have a block like this, every [include-image](visuals/images#extension) plugin on this page will have `border` set to true.

```markdown
:include-image: visuals/regular-image.png
```

# Plugins :: Development :: PlaceHolder
answer-link: znai/plugins/development#placeholder

Please create [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/issues) if you are interested in plugins creation documentation.

# Configuration :: Basic :: Favicon
answer-link: znai/configuration/basic#favicon

Put a `favicon.png` file inside the root of your docs (next to your `toc` file)

# Configuration :: Styling
answer-link: znai/configuration/styling

Add `style.css` next to `toc` file to change look and feel of the resulting documentation website.

# Configuration :: Styling :: CSS Variables
answer-link: znai/configuration/styling#css-variables

There are dozens of css variables you can target directly first, before considering more cascading options with class names. Use your browser inspector tool to see which ones are used.

For example, to change font sizes, use:

```css
:root {
    --znai-regular-text-size: 16px;
    --znai-smaller-text-size: 14px;
    --znai-code-text-size: 13px;
    --znai-code-font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Courier New", monospace;
}
```

Note: consider only targeting variables and classes that starts with `znai-` prefix. Those are considered to be public API.

# Configuration :: Styling :: Dark Light Themes Overrides
answer-link: znai/configuration/styling#dark-light-themes-overrides

Example above targets both light and dark theme. If you want to target dark theme specifically, use:

```css
.theme-znai-dark {
    --znai-code-keyword-color: #5050af;
}
```

```

# Deployment :: Additional Files
answer-link: znai/deployment/additional-files

Znai automatically copies files like images to deploy location when you use them.

my-extra-dir
```

# Hub :: Introduction
answer-link: znai/hub/introduction

Znai has a server mode that can act as a Hub for your company documentations. In addition to serving static content, Hub provides:

- Landing page, with all the documentations separated by sections
- On-demand upload via CLI
- Automatic build artifacts watching to grab the latest docs

# Hub :: Setup :: Config File
answer-link: znai/hub/setup#config-file

Create the enterprise config file and set the path where Znai will store uploaded documentation:

# Hub :: Setup :: Run In Server Mode
answer-link: znai/hub/setup#run-in-server-mode

Run Znai in server mode in the directory with the config file:

```cli
znai serve --port=<port>
```

# Hub :: Setup :: Upload Documentation
answer-link: znai/hub/setup#upload-documentation

Set `ZNAI_SERVER_URL` environment variable to the full url of the server, e.g.:

```cli
export ZNAI_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:7070
```

Now you can run `upload` command to build and upload a documentation:

```cli
znai --deploy=/path/where/docresources/generate --doc-id=my-doc-id --upload
```

# Hub :: Build Artifacts Watch :: Todo
answer-link: znai/hub/build-artifacts-watch#todo

Please create [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/testingisdocumenting/znai/issues) if you are interested in automatically watching a set of directories for built documentations to automatically upload them to Hub.
