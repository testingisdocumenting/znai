`DDJT` goal is to make your tests data and logic focused.
 
```tabs
Groovy: :include-groovy: org/testingisdocumenting/testing/examples/people/PeopleManagementGroovyTest.groovy {entry: "diversified teams should have various levels and time at company"}
Java: :include-java: org/testingisdocumenting/testing/examples/people/PeopleManagementTest.java {entry: "diversifiedTeamsShouldHaveVariousLevelsAndTimeAtCompany"}
