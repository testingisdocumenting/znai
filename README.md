# Znai

`Znai` transforms Markdown files into rich, well-structured documentation served in a web front-end built on React. It provides many custom add-ons that supercharge basic generated docs with advanced layout features, dynamic references to code and test artifacts, and many visual and functional enhancements.

# Developer Setup
