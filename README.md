# Preview

`Znai` has a preview mode to automatically listen to local files changes. It automatically navigates to a page that was 
changed (directly or indirectly) and highlights the changes.

# Docs Hub

`Znai` has a free, open-source enterprise support. You can host multiple documentations using single site. It provides
landing page to list all the company inner guides. 

It also automatically detects documentations in the builds outputs and updates hosted documentations.

Examples (including using Google Cloud) and setup documentation are coming. Please create a GitHub issue if you want
to learn more about Enterprise setup. It will help me prioritize.
